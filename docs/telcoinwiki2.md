# telcoinwiki2 Repository Clone

A full clone of this repository has been created at `../telcoinwiki2` within the workspace. This clone contains the entire project history and working tree, so it can be treated as an independent repository.

## Next Steps

If you intend to push the clone to a remote, navigate to the cloned directory and configure the desired remote:

```bash
cd ../telcoinwiki2
git remote remove origin # optional if you plan to use a different remote
git remote add origin <new-remote-url>
git push -u origin <branch-name>
```

Feel free to continue development in either repository as needed.
